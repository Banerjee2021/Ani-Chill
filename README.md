# Ani-Chill

Ani & Chill is a website that I have designed. A platform where users can watch anime and enjoy it in a relaxed manner, similar to the concept of "Netflix and chill".

I have considered elements like user interface design, navigation, search functionality, user profiles, and of course, ensuring that the website is responsive and works well across different devices.
